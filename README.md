Product card file: 
Layout Approach & Responsiveness I used a card-based grid layout with Bootstrap's responsive column system (col-md-4 col-sm-6), ensuring products reflow neatly across screen sizes. The card maintains a consistent height (h-100) while allowing flexible content scaling.

For responsiveness: Images are constrained (object-fit: contain) to prevent distortion. Text truncation (substring) prevents overflow on small screens. Buttons stack vertically (flex-column) on mobile for better touch targets. This ensures a clean, adaptable product grid from desktop to mobile. ðŸš€
